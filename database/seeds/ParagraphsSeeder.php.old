            links to those items.  Perhaps the hardest thing is simply determining what day of the week it is.
            Thursday at stand-up I told of my plans for the next 24 hours thinking that it was Wednesday.

                    I'm enjoying the programming challenge of working in JavaScript.
                    I find concepts like the scope of variables and calling functions different 
                    from anything I've encountered before. Javascript is a combination of powerful
                    features, protection from making errors and \"why did they do that?\"  
                    It will take some time to master, but because of its power and libraries 
                    should be well worth the effort.  I am also going to learn C# just to give

                    cross-platform.  An added bonus is its claim to be great for 
                    rapid prototyping.  And then there is Rust by the Mozilla Foundation.
